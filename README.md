I'm a fresh graduate with a growing passion for Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. Currently exploring the fundamentals of ethical hacking, machine learning, and how these two fields intersect.

## Objective

My journey in networking has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
